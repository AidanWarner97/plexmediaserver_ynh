PlexMediaServer for Yunohost.

## Description
Plex organizes video, music and photos from personal media libraries and streams them to smart TVs, streaming boxes and mobile devices. It is a media player system and software suite consisting of many player applications for 10-foot user interfaces and an associated media server that organizes personal media stored on local devices. It is available for Mac OS X, Linux, and Microsoft Windows.[1] Plex also offers streaming apps for Roku and Chromecast.[2] Integrated Plex Channels provide users with access to a growing number of online content providers such as YouTube, Vimeo, TEDTalks, and CNN among others.[3] Plex also provides integration for cloud services[4] including Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, Copy and Bitcasa.[5]

Plex's front-end media player, Plex Home Theater (formerly Plex Media Center[6]), allows the user to manage and play video, photos, music, and podcasts from a local or remote computer running Plex Media Server. In addition, the integrated Plex Online service provides the user with a growing list of community-driven plugins for online content including Hulu, Netflix, and CNN video.[7]
